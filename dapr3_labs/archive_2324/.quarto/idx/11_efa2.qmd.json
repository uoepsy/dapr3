The $\\LL{}{}$ terms are called factor loadings, or loadings in short\n\n__Communality__ is sum of the squared factor loadings for each item.  \n\nIntuitively, for each row, the two $\\LL{}{}$s tell us how much each item depends on the two factors shared by the 16 items. The sum of the squared loadings tells us how much of one item's information is due to the shared factors.\n\nThe communality is a bit like the $R^2$ (the proportion of variance of an item that is explained by the factor structure). And the standardised loadings are the proportion of variance in an item explained by each factor after accounting for other other factors.  \n\n\nThe __Uniqueness__ of each item is simply $1 - \\text{communality}$.  \nThis is the leftover bit; the variance in each item that is left unexplained by the latent factors (this could be specific variance, or it could be error variance. the one thing we know is, it's not common variance).  \n\n_Side note: this is what sets Factor Analysis apart from PCA, which is the linear combination of total variance (including error) in all our items. FA allows some of the variance to be shared by the underlying factors, and considers the remainder to be unique to the individual items (or, in another, error in how each item measures the construct)._\n\nThe __Complexity__ of an item corresponds to how well an item reflects a _single_ underlying construct. Specifically, it is ${(\\sum \\lambda_i^2)^2}/{\\sum \\lambda_i^4}$, where $\\lambda_i$ is the loading on to the $i^{th}$ factor. It will be equal to 1 for an item which loads _only_ on one factor, and 2 if it loads evenly on to two factors, and so on. \n\n:::rtip\nIn R, we will often see these estimats under specific columns:  \n\n+ __h2__ = item communality  \n+ __u__  = item uniqueness  \n+ __com__ = item complexity\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n`r qbegin(qcounter())`\nUsing `fa.sort()`, examine the loadings of each item onto the factors, along with communalities, uniqueness and complexity scores.  \n\n\n- Do all factors load on 3+ items at a salient level?\n- Do all items have at least one loading above a salient cut off?\n- Are there any Heywood cases (communalities or standardised loadings $\\geq1$)? \n- Should we perhaps remove some complex items? \n- Does the solution account for an acceptable level of variance?  \n- Is the factor structure (items that load on to each factor) coherent, and does it make theoretical sense?  \n\n`r qend()`\n`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`\n```{r}\nfa.sort(pgmod)\n```\n\n- Both factors load on 3+ items at a salient level. \n- All except item7 has loadings $>0.3$. \n- There are no Heywood cases.\n- Item 3 loads quite highly on both factors (high complexity) \n- The solution explains 38% of the variance.  \n- The coherence of the factor structure will require us to look back at the questions themselves.

For instance, think back to our exercises on path mediation, where \"Health Locus of Control\" was measured as the \"average score on a set of items relating to perceived control over ones own health\". In doing so, we make the assumption that these variables provide measurements of the underlying latent construct **without error**.  \nIn fact, if we think about it a little, in our simple regression framework $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + ... + \\beta_kx_k + \\varepsilon$ all our predictor variables $x_1$ to $x_k$ are assumed to be measured without error - it is only our outcome $y$ that our model considers to have some randomness included (the $\\varepsilon$). This seems less problematic if our variables are representing something that is quite easily and reliably measured (time, weight, height, age, etc.), but it seems inappropriate when we are concerned with something more abstract. For instance, two people both scoring 11 on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale does not necessarily mean that they have _identical_ levels of anxiety.  \n  \nThe inconsistency with which an observed variable reflects the underlying construct that we consider it to be measuring is termed the *reliability*.  \n\n:::frame\n**Reliability: A silly example** \n\nSuppose I'm trying to weigh [my dog](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f26FrRDyJxTvXvGS9). I have a set of scales, and I put him on the scales. He weighs in at 13.53kg. \nI immediately do it again, and the scales this time say 13.41kg. I do it again. 13.51kg, and again, 13.60kg. \nWhat is happening? Is Dougal's weight (Dougal is the dog, by the way) randomly fluctuating by 100g? Or are my scales just a bit inconsistent, and my observations contain measurement error?  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n    measurement =1:4,\n    dougal = c(13.53,13.41,13.51,13.6)\n) %>% \n    ggplot(.,aes(x=measurement,y=dougal))+\n    geom_point()+\n    geom_hline(yintercept=13.483,lty=\"dashed\")+\n    geom_text(x=3,y=13.484,label=\"Dougal's true weight (unknown to us)\",\n              vjust=-.5)+\n    labs(y=\"Dougal's Weight\")\n```\n\nI take him to the vets, where they have a much better set of weighing scales, and I do the same thing (measure him 4 times). The weights are 13.47, 13.49, 13.48, 13.48.  \nThe scales at the vets are clearly *more __reliable__*. We still don't know Dougal's *true* weight, but we are better informed to estimate it if we go on the measurements from the scales at the vet.^[Of course this all assuming that the scales aren't completely miscalibrated] \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n    scales = rep(c(\"mine\",\"vets\"),each=4),\n    measurement = c(1:4,1:4),\n    dougal = c(13.53,13.41,13.51,13.6, 13.47, 13.49, 13.48, 13.48)\n) %>% \n    ggplot(.,aes(x=measurement,y=dougal, col=scales))+\n    geom_point()+\n    geom_path()+\n    geom_hline(yintercept=13.483,lty=\"dashed\")+\n    geom_text(inherit.aes=F, x=3,y=13.484,label=\"Dougal's true weight (unknown to us)\",vjust=-.5)+\n    labs(y=\"Dougal's Weight\")\n```\n:::\n\nAnother way to think about reliability is to consider the idea that more error means less reliability: \n$$\\text{observations = truth + error}$$  \n\n\nThere are different types of reliability:  \n\n- **test re-test reliability:** correlation between values over repeated measurements. \n- **alternate-form reliability:** correlation between scores on different forms/versions of a test (we might want different versions to avoid practice effects). \n- **Inter-rater reliability:** correlation between values obtained from different raters. \n- **split-half reliability:** correlation between scores of two equally sized subsets of items. \n\nThe form of reliability we are going to be most concerned with here is known as **Internal Consistency**. This is the extent to which items within a scale are correlated with one another. There are two main measures of this:\n\n  \n\n__Alpha & Omega__  \n\n**Cronbach's $\\alpha$** ranges from 0 to 1 (higher is better). You can get this using the `alpha()` function from the **psych** package. The formula is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Cronbach's } \\alpha &= \\frac{n \\cdot \\overline{cov(ij)}}{\\overline{\\sigma^2_i} + (n-1) \\cdot \\overline{cov(ij)}}  \\\\\n\\\\\n\\text{where}:  & \\qquad\n& n = \\text{number of items} \\\\\n& \\overline{cov(ij)} = \\text{average covariance between item-pairs}  \\\\\n& \\overline{\\sigma^2_i} = \\text{average item variance}  \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n**McDonald's Omega ($\\omega$)** is substantially more complicated, but avoids the limitation that Cronbach's alpha which assumes that all items are equally related to the construct. You can get it using the `omega()` function from the **psych** package.

And the standardised loadings are the proportion of variance in an item explained by each factor after accounting for other other factors.  \n\n\nThe __Uniqueness__ of each item is simply $1 - \\text{communality}$.  \nThis is the leftover bit; the variance in each item that is left unexplained by the latent factors (this could be specific variance, or it could be error variance. the one thing we know is, it's not common variance).  \n\n_Side note: this is what sets Factor Analysis apart from PCA, which is the linear combination of total variance (including error) in all our items. FA allows some of the variance to be shared by the underlying factors, and considers the remainder to be unique to the individual items (or, in another, error in how each item measures the construct)._\n\nThe __Complexity__ of an item corresponds to how well an item reflects a _single_ underlying construct. Specifically, it is ${(\\sum \\lambda_i^2)^2}/{\\sum \\lambda_i^4}$, where $\\lambda_i$ is the loading on to the $i^{th}$ factor.

For instance, think back to our exercises on path mediation, where \"Health Locus of Control\" was measured as the \"average score on a set of items relating to perceived control over ones own health\". In doing so, we make the assumption that these variables provide measurements of the underlying latent construct **without error**.  \nIn fact, if we think about it a little, in our simple regression framework $y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + ... + \\beta_kx_k + \\varepsilon$ all our predictor variables $x_1$ to $x_k$ are assumed to be measured without error - it is only our outcome $y$ that our model considers to have some randomness included (the $\\varepsilon$). This seems less problematic if our variables are representing something that is quite easily and reliably measured (time, weight, height, age, etc.), but it seems inappropriate when we are concerned with something more abstract. For instance, two people both scoring 11 on the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale does not necessarily mean that they have _identical_ levels of anxiety.  \n  \nThe inconsistency with which an observed variable reflects the underlying construct that we consider it to be measuring is termed the *reliability*.  \n\n:::frame\n**Reliability: A silly example** \n\nSuppose I'm trying to weigh [my dog](https://photos.app.goo.gl/f26FrRDyJxTvXvGS9). I have a set of scales, and I put him on the scales. He weighs in at 13.53kg. \nI immediately do it again, and the scales this time say 13.41kg. I do it again. 13.51kg, and again, 13.60kg. \nWhat is happening? Is Dougal's weight (Dougal is the dog, by the way) randomly fluctuating by 100g? Or are my scales just a bit inconsistent, and my observations contain measurement error?  \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n    measurement =1:4,\n    dougal = c(13.53,13.41,13.51,13.6)\n) %>% \n    ggplot(.,aes(x=measurement,y=dougal))+\n    geom_point()+\n    geom_hline(yintercept=13.483,lty=\"dashed\")+\n    geom_text(x=3,y=13.484,label=\"Dougal's true weight (unknown to us)\",\n              vjust=-.5)+\n    labs(y=\"Dougal's Weight\")\n```\n\nI take him to the vets, where they have a much better set of weighing scales, and I do the same thing (measure him 4 times). The weights are 13.47, 13.49, 13.48, 13.48.  \nThe scales at the vets are clearly *more __reliable__*. We still don't know Dougal's *true* weight, but we are better informed to estimate it if we go on the measurements from the scales at the vet.^[Of course this all assuming that the scales aren't completely miscalibrated] \n\n```{r}\n#| echo: false\ntibble(\n    scales = rep(c(\"mine\",\"vets\"),each=4),\n    measurement = c(1:4,1:4),\n    dougal = c(13.53,13.41,13.51,13.6, 13.47, 13.49, 13.48, 13.48)\n) %>% \n    ggplot(.,aes(x=measurement,y=dougal, col=scales))+\n    geom_point()+\n    geom_path()+\n    geom_hline(yintercept=13.483,lty=\"dashed\")+\n    geom_text(inherit.aes=F, x=3,y=13.484,label=\"Dougal's true weight (unknown to us)\",vjust=-.5)+\n    labs(y=\"Dougal's Weight\")\n```\n:::\n\nAnother way to think about reliability is to consider the idea that more error means less reliability: \n$$\\text{observations = truth + error}$$  \n\n\nThere are different types of reliability:  \n\n- **test re-test reliability:** correlation between values over repeated measurements. \n- **alternate-form reliability:** correlation between scores on different forms/versions of a test (we might want different versions to avoid practice effects). \n- **Inter-rater reliability:** correlation between values obtained from different raters. \n- **split-half reliability:** correlation between scores of two equally sized subsets of items. \n\nThe form of reliability we are going to be most concerned with here is known as **Internal Consistency**. This is the extent to which items within a scale are correlated with one another. There are two main measures of this:\n\n  \n\n__Alpha & Omega__  \n\n**Cronbach's $\\alpha$** ranges from 0 to 1 (higher is better). You can get this using the `alpha()` function from the **psych** package.
