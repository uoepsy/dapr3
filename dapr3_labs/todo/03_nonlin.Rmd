# Linear vs Non-Linear

We have already seen in the last couple of weeks that we can use MLM to study something 'over the course of X'. For instance in Week 1's weight change data, which was measured over the course of several assessments (Figure \@ref(fig:weightlin)), and in the novel word learning experiment from Week 2 our analysis was interested in change over the course of the experimental blocks. 
 
```{r weightlin, echo=FALSE,out.width="300px", fig.cap="Weight Maintain Model fitted values, from [Week 1 exercises](https://uoepsy.github.io/msmr/labs/01_intromlm.html#Some_Less_Guided_Exercises)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gca/weightchangelin.png")
```

**Longitudinal data** is the term commonly used to refer to any data in which repeated measurements are taken over a continuous domain. This opens up the potential for observations to be unevenly spaced, or missing at certain points, as well as the fact that many effects of interest are likely to display **non-linear patterns**. These exercises focus on including higher-order polynomials in MLM to capture non-linearity. 
  
## Motivation  

Suppose we had collected the data in Figure \@ref(fig:mcycle), and we wanted to fit a model to predict $y$ based on the values of $x$.  
```{r mcycle, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "A clearly non-linear pattern"}
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) %>%
  ggplot(.,aes(x=x,y=y))+
  geom_point()
```

A model? [Easy, peasy, lemon squeezy!](https://youtu.be/7mAFiPVs3tM) Let's use our old friend linear regression. 
Expand the box below to see the model estimates and plot of model fit.  

`r optbegin("My lovely linear model is the best linear model.", show=TRUE, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
```{r echo=FALSE}
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) %>%
lm(y~x,.) %>% summary
```
```{r mcycle2, echo=FALSE}
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) %>% 
  lm(y~x,.) %>%
  sjPlot::plot_model(type="pred") -> p 
p$x
```
`r optend()`

Job done? Clearly not - we need only overlay model upon raw data (Figure \@ref(fig:mcycle3)) to see we are missing some key parts of the pattern. 
```{r mcycle3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Uh-oh... "}
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) %>% 
  lm(y~x,.) %>%
  sjPlot::plot_model(type="pred", show.data = TRUE) -> p0
p0$x
```

**Thoughts about Model + Error**  

All our work here is in aim of making models of the world.  

1. Models are just models. They are simplifications, and so they don't perfectly fit to the observed world (indeed, how well a model fits to the world is often our metric for comparing models).  
2. $y - \hat y$. Our observed data minus our model predicted values (i.e. in linear regression our "residuals") reflect everything that we don't account for in our model
3. In an ideal world, our model accounts for all the systematic relationships, and what is left over (our residuals) is just randomness. If our model is mis-specified, or misses out something systematic, then our residuals will reflect this. 
4. We check for this by examining how much like randomness the residuals appear to be (zero mean, normally distributed, constant variance, i.i.d ("independent and identically distributed") - i.e., what gets referred to as the "assumptions"). 
5. We will **never** know whether our residuals contain only randomness, because we can never observe *everything*. 

<h/>

Let's just do a quick `plot(model)` for some diagnostic plots of my linear model:
```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) %>%
lm(y~x,.) %>% plot()
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Does it look like the residuals are independently distributed? Not really. 
We need to find some way of incorporating the non-linear relationship between y and x into our model. 

:::






# What's a polynomial?  

:::yellow
Polynomials are mathematical expressions which involve a sum of powers. For instance:

$y = x^2 + 4$  
$y = 4x^3 + 2x^2 + 9x$  
$y = x^6$  

:::

For our purposes, extending our model to include higher-order terms can fit non-linear relationships between two variables, for instance, fitting models with linear and quadratic terms ($\color{red}{y_i} = \color{blue}{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} \ + \beta_2 x^2_i} + \varepsilon_i$) and extending these to cubic ($\color{red}{y_i} = \color{blue}{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i} \ + \beta_2 x^2_i + \beta_3 x^3_i} + \varepsilon_i$) and beyond.  

```{r echo=FALSE}
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) %>% 
  lm(y~x+I(x^2),.) %>%
  sjPlot::plot_model(type="pred",show.data=TRUE) -> p

MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) %>% 
  lm(y~x+I(x^2)+I(x^3),.) %>% 
  sjPlot::plot_model(type="pred",show.data=TRUE) -> p1

p0$x + labs(subtitle="y ~ x + e") +
p$x + labs(subtitle="y ~ x + x^2 + e") +
p1$x + labs(subtitle="y ~ x + x^2 + x^3 + e") 
```

## Raw/Natural Polynomials

<div style="display:inline-block; width: 60%; vertical-align: top">
There are two types of polynomial we can construct. "Raw" (or "Natural") polynomials are the straightforward ones you might be expecting the table to the right to be filled with.  

These are simply the original values of the x variable to the power of 2, 3 and so on.  
  
We can quickly get these in R using the `poly()` function, with `raw = TRUE`. 
</div>
<div style="display:inline-block; width: 30%;">
<center>
```{r echo=FALSE}
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) -> df
cbind(x=1:5,`x^2`=rep("?",5),`x^3`=rep("?",5)) %>% rbind("...") %>% pander::pander()
```
</center>
</div>

```{r}
poly(1:10, degree = 3, raw=TRUE)
```

We can actually use `poly()` internally in fitting our linear model, if we want:  
```{r eval=FALSE}
lm(y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = T), data = df)
```
But note that the coefficients get named `poly(x, 3, raw = T)[1]`, `poly(x, 3, raw = T)[2]` etc.  
We can alternatively use Dan's code, which attaches these as columns to our data, named `poly1`, `poly2`, etc. 
```{r include=FALSE}
# source Dan's code
source("https://uoe-psychology.github.io/uoe_psystats/multivar/functions/code_poly.R")

df <- code_poly(df = df, predictor = 'x', poly.order = 3, orthogonal = FALSE, draw.poly = FALSE)

head(df)
```
Both will produce the same model output (but Dan's method produces these nice neat names for the coefficients!): 
```{r echo=FALSE}
lm(y ~ poly1 + poly2 + poly3, data = df) %>% summary()
```

With raw/natural polynomials, the terms `poly1`, `poly2` and `poly3` are correlated.  
Think think about why this might be - by definition, as $x^1$ increases, so will $x^2$, and so will $x^4$ and so on. 
We can visualise them: 
```{r}
matplot(poly(1:10, 3, raw=T), type="l")
```

And measure the correlation coefficients
```{r}
cor(poly(1:10, 3, raw=T)) %>% round(2)
```
Why might this be a problem? 
Well, this multicollinearity can lead to estimation problems, and means that our parameter estimates may change considerably depending upon what terms we include in our model, and it becomes more difficult to determine which ones are important, and what the effect sizes are. 
The table below shows the coefficients for models fitted to a randomly generated dataset, with `poly1`, `poly1+poly2`, and `poly1+poly2+poly3` as predictors (where `poly1`-`poly3` are **natural** polynomials). Notice that they change with the addition of each term.
```{r echo=FALSE}
df<-tibble(
  x = 1:10,
  y = x + 
  rnorm(1, mean = 100) * (x) +
  rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = .01) * (x) ^ 2 +
  rnorm(1, mean = -1) * (x) ^ 3 + 
  rnorm(10)
)
df <- code_poly(df = df, predictor = 'x', poly.order = 3, orthogonal = FALSE, draw.poly = FALSE)
full_join(
  broom::tidy(lm(y~poly1, df))[,1:2] %>% rename(`y~poly1` = estimate),
  broom::tidy(lm(y~poly1+poly2, df))[,1:2] %>% rename(`y~poly1+poly2` = estimate)
) %>% full_join(.,
  broom::tidy(lm(y~poly1+poly2+poly3, df))[,1:2] %>% rename(`y~poly1+poly2+poly3` = estimate)
) %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,~round(.,2)) %>% 
  mutate_all(~ifelse(is.na(.), "-", .)) %>% pander::pander()

```

## Orthogonal Polynomials  

"Orthogonal" polynomials are uncorrelated (hence the name). 
We can get these for $x = 1,2,...,9,10$ using the following code:
```{r}
poly(1:10, 3, raw = FALSE)
```
Notice that the first order term has been scaled, so instead of the values 1 to 10, we have values ranging from -0.5 to +0.5, centered on 0. 
Think about what this means for $x^2$.  
It will be uncorrelated with $x$ (because $-0.5^2 = 0.5^2$)!  
```{r}
matplot(poly(1:10, 3, raw=F), type="l")
```
The correlations are zero!
```{r}
cor(poly(1:10, 3, raw=F)) %>% round(2)
```
With some minor edits to Dan's code (`orthogonal = TRUE`): 
```{r}
df <- code_poly(df = df, predictor = 'x', poly.order = 3, orthogonal = TRUE, draw.poly = FALSE)
```

We can then fit the same models `y~poly1`, `y~poly1+poly2`, and `y~poly1+poly2+poly3` as predictors (where `poly1`-`poly3` are now **orthogonal** polynomials), and see that estimated coefficients do not change between models: 
```{r echo=FALSE}
full_join(
  broom::tidy(lm(y~poly1, df))[,1:2] %>% rename(`y~poly1` = estimate),
  broom::tidy(lm(y~poly1+poly2, df))[,1:2] %>% rename(`y~poly1+poly2` = estimate)
) %>% full_join(.,
  broom::tidy(lm(y~poly1+poly2+poly3, df))[,1:2] %>% rename(`y~poly1+poly2+poly3` = estimate)
) %>% mutate_if(is.numeric,~round(.,2)) %>% 
  mutate_all(~ifelse(is.na(.), "-", .)) %>% pander::pander()
```


:::green
**Remember what zero is!** 

With orthogonal polynomials, you need to be careful about interpreting coefficients. For raw polynomials the intercept remains the y-intercept (i.e., where the line hits the y-axis). The higher order terms can then be thought of from that starting point - e.g., "where $x$ is 2, $\hat y$ is $\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot 2 + \beta_2 \cdot 2^2 + \beta_3 \cdot 2^3 ...$".  
For orthogonal polynomials, the interpretation becomes more tricky. The intercept is the overall average of y, the linear predictor is the linear change pivoting around the mean of $x$ (rather than $x = 0$), the quadratic term corresponds to the steepness of the quadratic curvature ("how curvy is it?"), the cubic term to the steepness at the inflection points ("how wiggly is it?"), and so on.

# Exercises: Cognitive performance

30 Participants with probably Alzheimer's Disease completed 3 tasks over 10 time points: A memory task, and two scales investigating ability to undertake complex activities of daily living (cADL) and simple activities of daily living (sADL). Performance on all of tasks was calculated as a percentage of total possible score, thereby ranging from 0 to 100. 

The data is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/Az.rda](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/Az.rda).

There are lots of different ways to organise your file system/your life in R.  
You might be creating a new project each week, or a new folder, or just a new .Rmd.  

There's no *best* way to organise this - it is personal preference. 
However, one thing which appears to be common across most approaches is that having a lot of irrelevant stuff in your environment (top right pane) can get confusing and messy.  

We encourage you now to clear your environment for this week, and *then* load in the data.  

If you are worried that you are going to lose some of the objects in your environment, then this may be a sign that you are not using R to its full potential. The idea is that we can recreate all of our analyses by just running the relevant script!

**The secret source()**  

The `source()` function basically takes in R code and evaluates it. You can download R scripts with Dan's code [here](https://uoe-psychology.github.io/uoe_psystats/multivar/functions/get_pvalues.R) and [here](https://uoe-psychology.github.io/uoe_psystats/multivar/functions/code_poly.R).   

But you can also source them directly from the URLs, which runs the R code and creates the functions in your environment:

Fit a model! 

Steps:  

1. Add 1st and 2nd order natural polynomials to the data using the `code_poly()` function. 
2. Create a "baseline model", in which performance varies over time (with both linear and quadratic change), but no differences in Task are estimated. 

    - Think about your random effect structure - what are the observations grouped by? Are observations nested? What is the maximal model?  
    
3. Create a new model with a fixed effect of Task
4. Create a new model in which performance varies linearly over time between Task type.
5. Create a new model in which linear and quadratic performance over time varies between Task type.
6. Run model comparisons.

    - Memory performance declines even more steeply than cADL, with linear change of `r fixef(m.Az.full)[2] %>% round(.,2)` + `r fixef(m.Az.full)[7] %>% round(.,2)` = `r fixef(m.Az.full)[2] + fixef(m.Az.full)[7] %>% round(.,2)`, but it also has a quadratic effect of `r fixef(m.Az.full)[9] %>% round(.,2)`. This is positive, which means it is $\cup$-shaped (rather than $\cap$-shaped).

:::int
Performance in all tasks starts out the same [thanks, natural polynomials!]. Linear change over time is different depending on task type: compared to complex ADL tasks, decline in simple ADL tasks is slower and decline in Memory is faster. Decline in cADL and sADL tasks is approximately linear, whereas decline in Memory has more curvature (reaching floor?)

Some alternatives, which you may come across in future work, are listed below.

**Piecewise linear regression:** fit a linear model with cut point(s) along x (determine cut points by greatest reduction in mean squared error $\sigma$)
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="350px"}
MASS::mcycle %>%
  rename(y=accel,x=times) %>% filter(x>20) -> df
breaks <- df$x[which(df$x >= 20 & df$x <= 40)]
mse <- numeric(length(breaks))
for(i in 1:length(breaks)){
 piecewise1 <- lm(y ~ x*(x < breaks[i]) + x*(x>=breaks[i]),df)
 mse[i] <- summary(piecewise1)[6]
}
mse <- as.numeric(mse)
#breaks[which(mse==min(mse))]
piecewise2 <- lm(y ~ x*(x <= 33) + x*(x > 33), df)
df %>% mutate(
  pred = predict(piecewise2),
  se = predict(piecewise2,se.fit = T)$se
) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x=x,y=pred))+
  geom_line(aes(group=x>33),lwd=1)+
  #geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pred-(1.96*se),ymax=pred+(1.96*se),group=x>33),alpha=.2)+
  geom_point(aes(y=y))+labs(y="y",title="Predicted values of y", subtitle="y ~ x*(x < 33) + x*(x > 33)")
```

**Piecewise polynomial** fit the model $y ~ x + x^2 + x^3$ to equal chunks of x.  

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="350px"}
mod<-function(ddf){lm(y~poly(x,3), data=ddf)}

df %>% mutate(pieces = cut(x,3)) %>% 
  group_by(pieces) %>%
  nest_legacy() %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, mod),
    fit = map(model, ~fitted(.))
  ) %>%
  unnest_legacy(data,fit) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x=x))+
  geom_point(aes(y=y))+
  geom_line(aes(y=fit, col=pieces),lwd=1)+
  theme_minimal() + guides(col=FALSE)+
  labs(title="Predicted values of y",subtitle="y~ x + x^2 + x^3 for 3 cuts of x")
```


**Splines, penalised splines & GAMS** 

This begins to open a huge can of worms, but if you foresee yourself needing these sort of tools, then Simon Wood, author of the **mgcv** R package for fitting generalised additive models (GAMS), is now in the maths department at Edinburgh. He has plenty of materials on [his webpage](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~swood34/talks/snw-Koln.pdf) (Warning, these are fairly technical). There are also a reasonable number of tutorials [online which are really good](https://www.google.com/search?hl=&site=&q=gam+in+r+tutorial).  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="350px"}
library(mgcv)
gam(y~s(x,bs="cr"),df, family="gaussian") -> m
df %>% mutate(
  pred = predict(m),
  se = predict(m,se.fit = T)$se
) %>% 
  ggplot(.,aes(x=x,y=pred))+
  geom_line(lwd=1)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=pred-(1.96*se),ymax=pred+(1.96*se)),alpha=.2)+
  geom_point(aes(y=y))+labs(y="y",title="Predicted values of y", subtitle="mgcv::gam(y ~ s(x, b = 'cr'))")
```
