# Video game aggression and the dark triad 

:::frame
__Dataset: NGV.csv__  

These data are from an experiment designed to investigate how the realism of video games is associated with more/less unnecessarily aggressive gameplay, and whether this differs depending upon a) the playing mode (playing on a screen vs VR headset), and b) individual differences in the 'dark triad' personality traits.  

The experiment involved playing 10 levels of a game in which the objective was to escape a maze. Various obstacles and other characters were present throughout the maze, and players could interact with these by side-stepping or jumping over them, or by pushing or shooting at them. All of these actions took the same amount of effort to complete (pressing a button), and each one achieved the same end (moving beyond the obstacle and being able to continue through the maze).  

Each participant completed all 10 levels twice, once in which all characters were presented as cartoons, and once in which all characters were presented as realistic humans and animals. The layout of the level was identical in both, the only difference being the depiction of objects and characters. For each participant, these 20 levels ($2 \times 10$ mazes) were presented in a random order. Half of the participants played via a screen, and the other half played via a VR headset. For each level played, we have a record of "needless game violence" (NGV) which was calculated via the number of aggressive (pushing/shooting) actions taken (+0.5 for every action that missed an object, +1 for every action aimed at an inanimate object, and +2 for every action aimed at an animate character).  
Prior to the experiment, each participant completed the Short Dark Triad 3 (SD-3), which measures the three traits of machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy.

#### Hints

- There's a lot to unpack in the research aim: _"how the realism of video games is associated with more/less unnecessarily aggressive gameplay, and whether this differs depending upon a) the playing mode (playing on a screen vs VR headset), and b) individual differences in the 'dark triad' personality traits."_    


:::

`r qend()`
`r solbegin(label="1 - some quick checks", slabel=F, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`


```{r}
ngv <- read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/NGV.csv")
```

Let's make things factors and see where we stand: 
```{r}
ngv <- ngv |> 
  mutate(
    PID = factor(PID),
    level = factor(level),
    character = factor(character),
    mode = factor(mode)
  )

summary(ngv)
```

everything looks good to me! All ranges looks fine.  

How many people do we have? 
```{r}
dim(table(ngv$PID, ngv$character))
```
76!  
Does everyone have 10 datapoints for cartoon and 10 for realistic?  
```{r}
any(table(ngv$PID, ngv$character)!=10)
```
yes, they do!  


`r solend()`
`r solbegin(label="2 - some exploratory plots", slabel=F, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

Okay. Let's plot.. 
The question asks about _"how the realism of video games is associated with more/less unnecessarily aggressive gameplay"_.  

So we'll put the `character` on the x-axis and our outcome `NGV` on the y:  
I like jitters, but you could put boxplots or violin plots too!  
```{r}
ggplot(ngv, aes(x = character, y = NGV)) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=.2, alpha=.2)
```

We're also interested in whether this differs depending on the mode of gameplay (screen vs VR headset). So we could facet_wrap perhaps? or colour?  
Let's also plot the means - i'll put those to the side of all the jittered points with a "nudge".. 
```{r}
ggplot(ngv, aes(x = character, y = NGV, col = mode)) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=.2, alpha=.2) +
  stat_summary(geom="pointrange", position = position_nudge(x=.25))
```

As well as looking at whether the `NGV~character` relationship differs between modes, we're also interested in the differences in this relationship due to individual differences in the dark triad personality traits. We have these measured for each person, so we can just use a similar idea:  
```{r}
ggplot(ngv, aes(x = character, y = NGV, col = factor(P))) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=.2, alpha=.2) +
  stat_summary(geom="pointrange", position = position_nudge(x=.25))

ggplot(ngv, aes(x = character, y = NGV, col = factor(M))) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=.2, alpha=.2) +
  stat_summary(geom="pointrange", position = position_nudge(x=.25))

ggplot(ngv, aes(x = character, y = NGV, col = factor(N))) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=.2, alpha=.2) +
  stat_summary(geom="pointrange", position = position_nudge(x=.25))
```

What do we get from all these plots? Well, it looks like mode _might_ be changing the relationship between character and violence. 
It also looks like there's a considerable effect of the dark triad on the amount of violence people use! Of course, in these individual plots, it's hard to ascertain the extent to which plots showing differences between levels of Narcissism are due to Narcissism or due to differences in Psychopathy (all the dark triad traits are fairly correlated)
```{r}
ngv |> select(P,N,M) |>
  cor() |> round(2)
```

So we need to do some modelling! 


`r solend()`
`r solbegin(label="3 - fitting a model", slabel=F, show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

__NOTE:__ This is how I might approach this question. There are lots of other things that we could quite sensibly do!  


- We know that we're interested in `NGV ~ character`.  
- We also have the additional question of whether this is different between modes - `NGV ~ character * mode`.  
- And whether the `NGV ~ character` association is modulated by Psychopathy `NGV ~ character * P`, and by Narcissism `NGV ~ character * N`, and by Machiavellianism `NGV ~ character * M`.  

We could fit these all in one:  
`NGV ~ character * (mode + P + M + N)`  

We have multiple observations per participant `PID`, and we also have multiple observations for each level `level`. All participants see every level, and every level is seen by all participants. It's not the case that a level is unique to a single participant, so these are _crossed_.  
`( ?? | PID) + ( ?? | level)`  

Participants plays both the cartoon and the realistic versions, so we could have variation between participants in how realism affects violence - `(1 + character | PID)`. Beyond this, all variables are measured at the participant level, so we can't have anything else.  

For the levels, each level is played by some participants in VR headsets and some participants on a screen, so we could have some levels for which VR feels very different (and makes you play more violently?) - `(mode | level)`.  We could also have some levels for which the realism has a bigger effect - `(character | level)`, and also have some levels for which people high on the dark triad play differently - i.e. the dark triad could result in lots of violence in level 2, but not in level 3 - `(P + M + N | level)`.  

_(you could also try to fit the interactions in the random effects here but i'm not going to even try!)_  
```{r}
m0 = lmer(NGV ~ character * (mode + P + M + N) + 
            (1 + character | PID) + 
            (1 + character + mode + P + M + N | level), data = ngv)
```

after some simplification, I end up at the model below. You might end up at a slightly different random effect structure, and that is completely okay! The important thing is to be transparent in your decisions.  
```{r}
m1 = lmer(NGV ~ character * (mode + P + M + N) + 
            (1 + character | PID) + 
            (1 + mode | level), data = ngv)
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Check the assumptions of your model


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Hints

We have a multilevel model, so we have assumptions at multiple levels! See [5A#mlm-assumptions-diagnostics](05a_assump.html#mlm-assumptions-diagnostics){target="_blank"}.  

Be careful - QQplots with few datapoints can make things look weirder than they are - try a histogram too 


:::


`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`
Here are some assumption plots: 
```{r}
plot(m1)
plot(m1,
     form = sqrt(abs(resid(.))) ~ fitted(.),
     type = c("p","smooth"))
```

There's something weird going on in the left hand side with a bunch of points looking funny! My guess is that this may well come out when examining influence. 

In the QQplots of the random effects below we can see a couple of participants are a bit off - this may well be what we are seeing above.  
```{r echo=c(2,3,4,5)}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
qqnorm(ranef(m1)$PID[,1],main="1|PID");qqline(ranef(m1)$PID[,1])
qqnorm(ranef(m1)$PID[,2],main="character|PID");qqline(ranef(m1)$PID[,2])
qqnorm(ranef(m1)$level[,1],main="1|level");qqline(ranef(m1)$level[,1])
qqnorm(ranef(m1)$level[,2],main="mode|level");qqline(ranef(m1)$level[,2])
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

The QQplots for the level random effects are hard to evaluate in part because there aren't many levels (only 10). Let's do some histograms too. They don't look _terrible_.. 

```{r echo=c(2,3,4,5)}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(ranef(m1)$PID[,1],main="1|PID")
hist(ranef(m1)$PID[,2],main="character|PID")
hist(ranef(m1)$level[,1],main="1|level")
hist(ranef(m1)$level[,2],main="mode|level")
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
```

Our model predictions don't look great either. Something is happening at values of 0?  

```{r}
library(performance)
check_predictions(m1)
```

`r solend()`

`r qbegin(qcounter())`
Check the extent to which your results may be sensitive to certain influential observations, or participants, or levels!  


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### Hints

See [5A #influence](05a_assump.html#influence){target="_blank"} for two packages that can assess influence. 

:::


`r qend()`
`r solbegin(show=params$SHOW_SOLS, toggle=params$TOGGLE)`

let's check for influential participants first:  
```{r}
library(HLMdiag)
inf2 <- hlm_influence(m1,level="PID")
dotplot_diag(inf2$cooksd, index=inf2$PID, cutoff="internal")
```

and let's re-fit without those two weird people.. 
```{r}
m1a <- lmer(NGV ~ character * (mode + P + M + N) + 
            (1 + character | PID) + 
            (1 + mode | level), 
            data = ngv |> filter(!(PID %in% c("ppt_59","ppt_53"))))
```

Our conclusions change!  
The significance of `P` (which is the association between psychopathy and needless violence in the cartoon condition) depends upon exclusion of these two participants. 
I'm showing the table with Satterthwaite p-values as it's a bit quicker, but given that we have only 10 groups for the `level` random effect, it might be worth switching to KR
```{r}
library(sjPlot)
tab_model(m1,m1a, df.method="satterthwaite")
```

Note that our model predictions look much better
```{r}
check_predictions(m1a)
```

If we look at those two people - they just didn't do much (or any) "needless game violence".  
```{r}
ngv |> filter(PID %in% c("ppt_59","ppt_53")) |>
  ggplot(aes(x=character, y=NGV)) +
  geom_jitter(height=0, width=.2) + 
  facet_wrap(~PID)
```

Let's check for influential levels now:  
```{r}
inf3 <- hlm_influence(m1a,level="level")
dotplot_diag(inf3$cooksd)
```

and for influential observations
```{r}
inf1 <- hlm_influence(m1a,level=1)
dotplot_diag(inf1$cooksd)
```

#### motivation and grades in school children

This dataset contains information on 900 children from 30 different schools across Scotland. The data was collected as part of a study looking at **whether education-related motivation is associated with school grades. This is expected to be different for state vs privately funded schools.**   
All children completed an 'education motivation' questionnaire, and their end-of-year grade average has been recorded.    

It is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/schoolmot.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/schoolmot.csv).

#### monkey social status and problem solving ability

Our primate researchers have been busy collecting more data. They have given a sample of Rhesus Macaques various problems to solve in order to receive treats. Troops of Macaques have a complex social structure, but adult monkeys tend can be loosely categorised as having either a "dominant" or "subordinate" status. The monkeys in our sample are either adolescent monkeys, subordinate adults, or dominant adults. Each monkey attempted various problems before they got bored/distracted/full of treats. Each problems were classed as either "easy" or "difficult", and the researchers recorded whether or not the monkey solved each problem. 

We're interested in **how the social status of monkeys is associated with the ability to solve problems**.

#### mid-life happiness slump in great apes

Previous research has evidenced a notable dip in happiness for middle-aged humans. Interestingly, this phenomenon has even been observed in other primates, such as chimpanzees.  

The present study is interested in examining whether the 'middle-age slump' happens to a similar extent for Orangutans as it does for Chimpanzees. 

`r n_distinct(df$apeID)` apes (`r n_distinct(df$apeID[df$species=="chimp"])` Chimps and `r n_distinct(df$apeID[df$species=="orangutan"])` Orangutans) were included in the study. All apes were studied from early adulthood (10-12 years old for most great apes), and researchers administered the Happiness in Primates (HiP) scale to each participant every 3 years, up until the age of 40.  

The data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/midlife_ape.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/midlife_ape.csv){target="_blank"}.  

The dataset has already been cleaned, and the researchers have confirmed that it includes `r n_distinct(df$apeID[df$species=="chimp"])` Chimps and `r n_distinct(df$apeID[df$species=="orangutan"])` Orangutans, and every ape has complete data (i.e. 10 rows for each ape).

#### New Toys!
  
Recall the example from last semesters' USMR course, where the lectures explored linear regression with a toy dataset of how practice influences the reading age of toy characters (see [USMR Week 7 Lecture](https://uoepsy.github.io/usmr/2324/lectures/lecture06.html#/learning-to-read-1){target="_blank"}). We're going to now broaden our scope to the investigation of how practice affects reading age for **all** toys (not just Martin's Playmobil characters).  

You can find a dataset at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/toy2.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/toy2.csv){target="_blank"} containing information on 129 different toy characters that come from a selection of different families/types of toy.

#### Audio interference in executive functioning

This data is from a simulated study that aims to investigate the following research question: 

> How do different types of audio interfere with executive functioning, and does this interference differ depending upon whether or not noise-cancelling headphones are used? 

30 healthy volunteers each completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) - a commonly used test to assess processing speed and motor speed - a total of 15 times. During the tests, participants listened to either no audio (5 tests), white noise (5 tests) or classical music (5 tests). Half the participants listened via active-noise-cancelling headphones, and the other half listened via speakers in the room. Unfortunately, lots of the tests were not administered correctly, and so not every participant has the full 15 trials worth of data.  

The data is available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/efsdmt.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/efsdmt.csv).

#### dominance in adolescence of great apes

We have data from a large sample of great apes who have been studied between the ages of 1 to 10 years old (i.e. during adolescence). Our data includes 4 species of great apes: Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Gorillas and Orangutans. Each ape has been assessed on a primate dominance scale at various ages. Data collection was not very rigorous, so apes do not have consistent assessment schedules (i.e., one may have been assessed at ages 1, 3 and 6, whereas another at ages 2 and 8).  

The researchers are interested in examining how the adolescent development of dominance in great apes differs between species.  

Data on the dominance scores of the apes are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apeage.csv){target="_blank"} and the information about which species each ape is are in [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/msmr_apespecies.csv){target="_blank"}.

#### trolley problems

The "Trolley Problem" is a thought experiment in moral philosophy that asks you to decide whether or not to pull a lever to divert a trolley. Pulling the lever changes the trolley direction from hitting 5 people to a track on which it will hit one person.  

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("images/trolley.png")
```

Previous research has found that the "framing" of the problem will influence the decisions people make: 

```{r}
#| echo: false
tribble(
  ~`positive frame`,~`neutral frame`,~`negative frame`,
  "5 people will be saved if you pull the lever; one person on another track will be saved if you do not pull the lever. All your actions are legal and understandable. Will you pull the lever?","5 people will be saved if you pull the lever, but another person will die. One people will be saved if you do not pull the lever, but 5 people will die. All your actions are legal and understandable. Will you pull the lever?",
  "One person will die if you pull the lever. 5 people will die if you do not pull the lever. All your actions are legal and understandable. Will you pull the lever?"
) |> gt::gt()
```

We conducted a study to investigate **whether the framing effects on moral judgements depends upon the stakes (i.e. the number of lives saved)**.  

120 participants were recruited, and each gave answers to 12 versions of the thought experiment. For each participant, four versions followed each of the positive/neutral/negative framings described above, and for each framing, 2 would save 5 people and 2 would save 15 people.

```
and you will find the `Az` object in your environment.  

The `Az` object contains information on 30 Participants with probable Alzheimer's Disease, who completed 3 tasks over 10 time points: A memory task, and two scales investigating ability to undertake complex activities of daily living (cADL) and simple activities of daily living (sADL). Performance on all of tasks was calculated as a percentage of total possible score, thereby ranging from 0 to 100. 

We're interested in *whether performance on these tasks differed at the outset of the study, and if they differed in their subsequent change in performance*.

```

This is synthetic data from a randomised controlled trial, in which `r nrow(tn)` therapists randomly assigned patients (each therapist saw between `r min(tn[,'np'])` and `r max(tn[,'np'])` patients) to a control or treatment group, and monitored their scores over time on a measure of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD7 - a 7 item questionnaire with 5 point likert scales).  

The control group of patients received standard sessions offered by the therapists. 
For the treatment group, 10 mins of each sessions was replaced with a specific psychoeducational component, and patients were given relevant tasks to complete between each session. All patients had monthly therapy sessions. Generalised Anxiety Disorder was assessed at baseline and then every visit over 4 months of sessions (5 assessments in total).

#### Test-enhanced learning  

An experiment was run to conceptually replicate "test-enhanced learning" (Roediger & Karpicke, 2006): two groups of 25 participants were presented with material to learn. One group studied the material twice (`StudyStudy`), the other group studied the material once then did a test (`StudyTest`). Recall was tested immediately (one minute) after the learning session and one week later. The recall tests were composed of 175 items identified by a keyword (`Test_word`). 

The critical (replication) prediction is that the `StudyStudy` group recall more items on the immediate test, but the `StudyTest` group will retain the material better and thus perform better on the 1-week follow-up test.  

The following code loads the data into your R environment by creating a variable called `tel`:

```{r}
#| eval: false
load(url("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/testenhancedlearning.RData"))
```

```{r}

```

`r nrow(pvtsc)` children from `r length(unique(pvt$school))` schools were included in the study. Children were assessed on a yearly basis for 7 years throughout primary school on a measure of vocabulary administered in English, the Picture Vocab Test (PVT). `r sum(pvtsc$isBilingual==0)` were monolingual English speakers, and `r sum(pvtsc$isBilingual==1)` were bilingual (english + another language). 

Previous research conducted on monolingual children has suggested that that scores on the PVT increase steadily up until the age of approximately 7 or 8 at which point they begin to plateau. The aim of the present study is to investigate differences in the development of vocabulary between monolingual and bilingual children.

#### work patterns and mental wellbeing 

The "Wellbeing in Work" dataset contains information on employee wellbeing, assessed at baseline (start of study), 12 months post, 24 months post, and 36 months post.  over the course of 36 months. 
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three employment conditions:

- control: No change to employment. Employees continue at 5 days a week, with standard allocated annual leave quota.    
- unlimited_leave : Employees were given no limit to their annual leave, but were still expected to meet required targets as specified in their job description. 
- fourday_week: Employees worked a 4 day week for no decrease in pay, and were still expected to meet required targets as specified in their job description.

### evaluating an intervention to reduce adolescent aggressive behaviours

In 2010 A US state's commissioner for education was faced with growing community concern about rising levels of adolescent antisocial behaviours. 

After a series of focus groups, the commissioner approved the trialing of an intervention in which yearly Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions were offered to the parents of a cohort of students entering 10 different high schools. Every year, the parents were asked to fill out an informant-based version of the Aggressive Behaviour Scale (ABS), measuring verbal and physical abuse, socially inappropriate behavior, and resisting care. Where possible, the same parents were followed up throughout the child's progression through high school. Alongside this, parents from a cohort of students entering 10 further high schools in the state were recruited to also complete the same informant-based ABS, but were not offered the PMT group sessions.  
The commissioner has two main questions: **Does the presentation of aggressive behaviours increase as children enter the secondary school system? If so, is there any evidence for the effectiveness of Parent Management Training (PMT) group sessions in curbing the rise of aggressive behaviors during a child's transition into the secondary school system?**

#### the influence of music on driving speeds

These data are simulated to represent data from a fake experiment, in which participants were asked to drive around a route in a 30mph zone. Each participant completed the route 3 times (i.e. "repeated measures"), but each time they were listening to different audio (either speech, classical music or rap music). Their average speed across the route was recorded. 
This is a fairly simple design, that we might use to ask **"how is the type of audio being listened to associated with driving speeds?"** 

The data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv).  


```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(
  variable = names(read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/drivingmusicwithin.csv")),
  description = c("Participant Identifier","Avg Speed Driven on Route (mph)","Music listened to while driving (classical music / rap music / spoken word)")
) |> gt::gt()

#### CBT and stress levels

These data are simulated to represent data from 50 participants, each measured at 3 different time-points (pre, during, and post) on a measure of stress. Participants were randomly allocated such that half received some cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) treatment, and half did not. This study is interested in assessing **whether the two groups (control vs treatment) differ in how stress changes across the 3 time points**. 

The data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/stressint.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/stressint.csv).

#### erm.. I don't believe you

These data are simulated to represent data from 30 participants who took part in an experiment designed to investigate **whether fluency of speech influences how believable an utterance is perceived to be**.  

Each participant listened to the same 20 statements, with 10 being presented in fluent speech, and 10 being presented with a disfluency (an "erm, ..."). Fluency of the statements was counterbalanced such that 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as fluent and 11 to 20 as disfluent, and the remaining 15 participants heard statements 1 to 10 as disfluent, and 11 to 20 as fluent. The order of the statements presented to each participant was random. Participants rated each statement on how believable it is on a scale of 0 to 100.  

The data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/erm_belief.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/erm_belief.csv).

#### domain differences in cognitive aging

These data are simulated to represent a large scale international study of cognitive aging, for which data from 17 research centers has been combined. The study team are interested in **whether different cognitive domains have different trajectories as people age**. Do all cognitive domains decline at the same rate? Do some decline more steeply, and some less? The literature suggests that scores on cognitive ability are predicted by educational attainment, so they would like to control for this.  

Each of the 17 research centers recruited a minimum of 14 participants (Median = 21, Range 14-29) at age 48, and recorded their level of education (in years). Participants were then tested on 5 cognitive domains: processing speed, spatial visualisation, memory, reasoning, and vocabulary. Participants were contacted for follow-up on a further 9 occasions (resulting in 10 datapoints for each participant), and at every follow-up they were tested on the same 5 cognitive domains. Follow-ups were on average 3 years apart (Mean = 3, SD = 0.8). 

The data are available at [https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cogdecline.csv](https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cogdecline.csv). 

```{r echo=FALSE}

  variable = names(read_csv("https://uoepsy.github.io/data/cogdecline.csv")),

                  "Score on Memory domain task",
                  "Score on Reasoning domain task",
