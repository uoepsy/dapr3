dapr3 sits at the end of the DAPR journey, and really it's designed to prepare you for much of the research you're about to undertake in your dissertations.

# What you will learn

.pull-left[
### Weeks 1-5

__Multilevel Models__  

- Refresher of Linear Models
- Multilevel Linear Models
- Assumptions & Diagnostics
- Centering & Logistic Multilevel Models
- Recap

]

???
as such, we're going to learn some of the methods that are most commonly utilised in dissertations. 

these include multilevel models, which is going to be the focus of the first block of the DAPR3

course mainly delivered in lectures and labs, with accompanying readings.  

we also have discussion forums and other avenues for you to get support  

and then there is the assessment.

# Labs

- A time and place to work on the exercises

  - work should be done in **RStudio**  
  
  - working in small groups is encouraged
  
  - a team of tutors will be on-hand to answer any questions

.br3.center.bg-green.white.f3[
Check your personal timetable to find out which lab to attend.
]


???
the lab sessions are a time and place to work on exercises.  

we've got a bunch of lovely tutors who will be there to answer questions. just raise your hand and they'll come over when they're free.  
- working in groups.  


- statistics, and especially R, is a very _practical_ skill.  
- we can't teach people to swim by just giving lectures on how to swim.
