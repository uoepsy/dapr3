# p-values in `lm()`

In simple LM, we test the reduction in residual SS (sums of squares), which follows an $F$ distribution with a known $df$.  

$F$ tests for each predictor will have $k$ numerator degrees of freedom (how many parameters) and $n-k-1$ denominator degrees of freedom.  

The $t$-statistics for coefficients will follow $t$-distributions with the same $n-k-1$ degrees of freedom.

$$
\begin{align}
F \qquad & = \qquad \frac{MS_{model}}{MS_{residual}} \qquad &= \qquad \frac{SS_{model}/df_{model}}{SS_{residual}/df_{residual}} \\
\quad \\
& & df_{model} = k \\
& & df_{residual} = n-k-1 \\
\end{align}
$$

- in simple regression
- sums squared residuals
- followed F 
- degrees of freedom 
  - how many things are we testing?  
  - how many things are left over free to move around?  
- t tests for coefficients follow same logic.

# p-values in `lmer()`?  

- In certain *very specific* conditions, we can work out what the degrees of freedom are. 

- Parameter estimates from these models are not based on minimising sums of squared residuals  

  - They are the ML/REML estimates

  - This is good - it means they can handle unbalanced designs and complex random effect structures

- But: 
  - unclear how to calculate denominator $df$
  - unclear whether the test statistics even follow an $F$ distribution
  
???

- in very specific situations. if we have a perfectly balanced study with the same number of observations in each condition, and same number of obs per cluster etc. 
- we can then calculate the degrees of freedom


- but, even then, the distribution of a test statistic when the null hypothesis is true is **unknown.**
- remember idea of NHST

- in LM, we can solve our equations to find out B. 
- in MLM, we don't. we let computer go brrr.

# Kenward-Rogers 

- Adjusts standard errors to avoid small sample bias
- Approximates denominator degrees of freedom

???
- kenward rogers is a good option for when we have small samples 
- it uses a complicated method of approximating the degrees of freedom
  - so it's still framed as F and t
- adjusts our standard errors to correct for bias from smaller samples
- useful = REML! 

- 'small samples' = ? 
- mainly talking level 2 to be honest

anova(restricted_model, full_model)

???
- remember "likelihood" = a function that associates to a parameter the probability (or probability density) of observing the given sample data.
- LRT = two models
  - under which model are we more likely to observe our data?  
- question of how much "more likely under m1" is enough.  
- as N -> inf, then comparing likelihoods follows a chi square  

- but with small N, no! so not a great option for small samples.  
- however, v easy. SLIDE
- DRAW

# Likelihood-based CIs

- Evaluates the curvature of the likelihood surface at the estimate.  

  - sharp curvature = more certainty in estimate  
  
  - gradual curvature = less certainty in estimate  
  
- models need to be fitted with ML, not REML  


```{r}
confint(cogtime_model, method="profile")
```


???
- DRAW
if curvature of likelihood function is very sharp at the ML estimates, then changes to the parameter estimates in any direction greatly reduce the likelihood, indicating that there is more certainty that the ML estimates represent the best solution.

What we are going to focus on here is bootstrapping multilevel models.  
There are various different ways we can bootstrap, which vary in the assumptions they make about our model and about the process that generates our data.  
Today we'll focus on parametric bootstrapping. This assumes that our model is correct, for instance, in that our residuals and our random effect terms are normally distributed. 

---
# Parametric Bootstrap

The basic premise is that we:  

1. fit model(s) to data

2. Do many times:

  - simulate data based on the parameters of the fitted model(s)
  - compute some statistic/estimates from the simulated data

3. Construct a distribution of possible values
