```

Every participant:  
```{r}

```

Participants 1 to 16:
```{r}

```

A weird looking participant:
```{r}


```


Ignoring condition for a minute:
In this model, we are allowing the intercept and the slope of size to vary by-participant.  
```{r}



```

This means that the model will predict:

- each person has a different estimated rating when size = 0
- how ratings change with size can be different for each person

To show this, let's just quickly plot fitted lines for the first 16:  
```{r}


```

These are *predictions* that we kind of get 'after the model is estimated'. 
The parameters that actually define our model (i.e., the ones that the estimation process tries to find the best values for):  

```{r}


```

What if we ignored "people"?
```{r}

```


Why not `condition|pid`?
