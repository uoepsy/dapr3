## Labs

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}
- a time and place to work on the exercises

- you will be working in groups

- a team of tutors will be there to help

::: {.column width="30%"}
![](img_sandbox/playmo_group.jpg)
:::

::::

:::myblock

- labs are the best place to get hands-on experience with R
- you are expected to attend (check your personal timetable to see which one)

:::


::: notes
- statistics, and especially R, is a very _practical_ skill.  

- we can't teach people to swim by just giving lectures on how to swim.

## ![](img_sandbox/exam.svg){width=70px style="transform: translateY(50%);"} Group Project (30%)

- Form your groups (max 5 people) in labs during weeks 1 and 2. 
    - Sit together and work on the exercises.  


- Groups will be formally 'set' in Week 3 labs, after which you cannot change who you complete the group project with.  
    - if you are not present in Week 3 labs you will be randomly allocated to a group.  


- The lab sessions are for completing the exercises, not the group report. Please arrange with your group when and how you plan to complete the project.

## Tips for Survival

- active engagement! 

- use the piazza forums and other forms of support

- keep on top of the coursework

- remember that some things will feel difficult at first
  - what's hard for you may be easy for others
  - what's easy for you may be hard for others
- most importantly, _don't give up_


## R and RSTUDIO!!!

__Please install a version of R and RStudio on your own computer.__  

__Please update any existing installations__

For update/installation instructions, see [https://edin.ac/3B0oi5A](https://edin.ac/3B0oi5A){target="_blank"}  
    - *please follow these instructions carefully*
