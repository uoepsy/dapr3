Now that we've taken a bit of time to look at assumptions and diagnostic in multilevel models, we're going to move on to thinking about random effect structures in a bit more detail.

# Nested Structures

- the things in a cluster belong __only__ to that cluster.  

```{r out.width="450px", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/albatross-chick-between-parents-feet-falkland-islands-picture-id642348358?s=2048x2048")
```

???
the idea of a nested structure here is that each observation belongs to only one higher up level. 
so each chick is in a nest, and they don't go into other nests.  
each nest is in a tree, and the nests don't move to other trees.

count:false
# Nested Structures

- the things in a cluster belong __only__ to that cluster.  

- **`(1 | school/class)`** or **`(1 | school) + (1 | class:school)`**

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("jk_img_sandbox/structure_nestednew.png")
```

???
we can have multiple levels of nesting. for instance, children in classes in schools. 
in this case, we need to specify the nesting in our model. 
so we use a forward slash, or a longer format which is more explicitly fitting a random intercept for each school, and a random intercept for each class within each school.

---
# Nested Structures - labels!  

- the things in a cluster belong __only__ to that cluster.  

- If labels are unique, **`(1 | school) + (1 | class)`** is the same as **`(1 | school/class)`**  

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("jk_img_sandbox/structure_nestedlabnew.png")
```

???
one thing to note is that if our grouping labels are unique. for instance, all the classes from school A are called "Class A"-something, then we can also write it like this. 
in this case we don't have to specify the nesting of classes within schools explicitly because the labels of the classes are unique to each school. 
rather than the previous slide where there was a "class 1" label in all 3 schools, but these were actually DIFFERENT classes.

# Crossed Structures

- "crossed" = not nested!

???
crossed random effects are simply anything which is not nested. 

--

- **`(1 | subject) + (1 | task)`**  
- the things in a cluster can also belong to other clusters

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("jk_img_sandbox/structure_crossednew.png")
```

???
a typical example is where each participant completes the same set of tasks, or sees the same set of stimuli. 
if you want to carry on the schools, children example, you could consider subjects maths, english, history etc are not nested within schools, but history is taught in every school, and each school teaches every subject.

# Random Effects Revisited

**What do we mean by "random effects"?**  

$$
\text{... + }\underbrace{\text{(random intercept + random slopes | grouping structure)}}_{\text{random effects}}
$$
.pull-left[

People use different phrasings...   

- when referring to random slopes:
  - "random effects of x for g"  
  - "random effects of x by g"  
  - "by-g random effects of x"  
- when referring to random intercept:
  - "random effect for g"
  
common definition: "allow ___ to vary by g"
]
.pull-right[

__Nested__  
```
... + (1 + ... | g1 / g2)
... + (1 + ... | g1 ) + (1 + ... | g1:g2)
```

__Crossed__  
```
... + (1 + ... | g1 ) + (1 + ... | g2)
```

# Random Effects Revisited (2)

**Should variable `g` be fixed or random?**  

| Criterion: | Repetition: <br> _If the experiment were repeated:_ | Desired inference: <br> _The conclusions refer to:_ |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Fixed<br>**y ~ ... + g**  | <center>Same groups would be used</center>     |    <center>The groups used</center>                                   |
| Random<br>**y ~ ... + (...&#124;g)** | <center>Different groups would be used</center>   | <center>A population from which the groups used<br> are just a (random) sample</center> |


- If only small number of groups, estimating variance components may be unstable.  

- Partialling out group-differences as fixed effects *may* be preferable. 


???
in discussing random effect structures, it's worth reiterating our distinction between fixed and random effects. sometimes it may be preferable to fit grouping as a fixed effect, if, for instance, we have a small number of clusters.

# Random Effects Revisited (3)

**I have  `y ~ 1 + x + (1 | g)` should I include by-g random slope of x?**  

If the effect of x can vary by g, then including `x | g` will give a better estimate of the uncertainty in the fixed effect of x.  

<br><br>
```
1. ACE ~ visit + (1 + visit | ppt)
2. ACE ~ visit + (1 | ppt)
```

1 is preferable to 2, especially because we're interested in estimating and testing the effect of visit.  

```
3. ACE ~ visit + covariate + (1 + visit + covariate | ppt)
4. ACE ~ visit + covariate + (1 + visit | ppt)
```

3 is preferable to 4 because it more accurately represents the world (people vary in how the covariate influences cognition). But it's less crucial here - we're not interested in assessing significance of covariate, we're just controlling for it.

- for a single ppt, the slope of `ACE ~ visit` exists in our study design.  
therefore, this *could* be different for different ppts!  
`(visit | ppt)` makes theoretical sense.
