# Things you can take away

<center>
<br><br>
<h2>NOTHING!</h2>  

(Other than the things you bring in with you like pens, pencils, calculator)

<br><br>
<b>
When you finish, you leave all papers (questions, answers, equation sheet) in the exam hall.  
</b></center>

<!-- --- -->
<!-- # Equation sheet -->
<!-- + Ideally double side printed. -->
<!--   + if you cant, either staple back to back, or take 2 sheets -->

<!-- + **BUT** -->
<!--   + the notes must only be within the box -->

<!-- + **If you have any notes outside the box, you will have your notes taken off of you and will be given a plain equation sheet** -->

<!-- + You must hand in your notes sheet with your other exam materials. -->

<small>

**approx 5 marks**  
**show your working** (could get marks for this if answer is wrong)  

think, e.g.:  
- calculating icc from a intercept only model  
- calculating coef from fixef and ranef  
- calculating indirect effects and total effects  
- calculating variance explained from eigenvalues  
- calculating SS loadings

<small>

**approx 6 marks**  
often these ask to define a couple of things.  
1 to 2 sentences each thing.  

think, e.g.:  

- "ICC"
- "random effects and fixed effects"
- "no pooling/complete pooling/partial pooling"
- "factor loading"
- "reliability"
- "indirect and direct effects"

<small>
**approx 10 marks**  
you have done this in the report, and lots of times in labs.  

Hint: PCA/EFA are not "research design/question"-based in the sense of estimation, so these questions are likely to be multilevel models and path analysis.   
  
You probably know more than you think you do.  
- e.g. start with an outcome variable.  
- ask yourself: "what in my question is asking about 'effects on Y'/'influences on Y'/'predicts Y'".

</ul>

<small>
**approx 10-20 marks**  
you have done this in the report, and also seen it plenty of times in the labs and lectures  

- the questions will list the things we expect comments on
- don't just parrot back numbers. provide *interpretation*  
- these usually provide information about the research aims, so place your answer in that context.  

These are going to be our main functions we have seen throughout DAPR3: `lmer()`, `principal()`, `sem()`, `fa()`  
print an output from the lab/lectures and annotate it. what does each bit of the output represent?
