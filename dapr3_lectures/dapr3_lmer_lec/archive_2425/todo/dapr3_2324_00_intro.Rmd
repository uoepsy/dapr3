course mainly delivered in lectures and labs, with accompanying readings.  

we also have discussion forums and other avenues for you to get support  

and then there is the assessment.

# Labs

- A time and place to work on the exercises

  - work should be done in **RStudio**  
  
  - working in small groups is encouraged
  
  - a team of tutors will be on-hand to answer any questions

.br3.center.bg-green.white.f3[
Check your personal timetable to find out which lab to attend.
]


???
the lab sessions are a time and place to work on exercises.  

we've got a bunch of lovely tutors who will be there to answer questions. just raise your hand and they'll come over when they're free.  
- working in groups.  


- statistics, and especially R, is a very _practical_ skill.  
- we can't teach people to swim by just giving lectures on how to swim.
