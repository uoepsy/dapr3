# Examples of clustered data

.pull-left[
- children within schools  

- patients within clinics  

- observations within individuals  
]
.pull-left[
```{r echo=FALSE}

```
]

???
- Simply. when observations have some grouping
- NOT:
  - Old v Young
  - Drug v Placebo
  - Condition 1 v Condition 2
- Those are typically the things we're wanting to estimate effects of. 

- Clusters are: 
  - groupings that are another kind of random sampling  
  - e.g. to sample school children, i randomly sample children from a random sample of schools

# Importance of Clustering

Clustering will likely result in measurements on observational units within a given cluster being more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.  

- For example, our measure of academic performance for children in a given class will tend to be more similar to one another (because of class specific things such as the teacher) than to children in other classes.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="60%",fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("jk_img_sandbox/lev1.png")
```

???
- why important?  

- [READ]
- e.g. children in a given class might score more similarly to one another than they do to children in other classes, because of things like how good the teacher is

- this is 'non-independence'! 
- the children are not independent from one another. 
- call back to our regression assumptions!  

- can happen a lot! 
  - children schools
  - employees departments
  - in dissertations - trials from participants


---
# ICC (intra-class correlation coefficient)

Clustering is expressed in terms of the correlation among the measurements within the same cluster - known as the __intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).__


There are various formulations of ICC, but the basic principle = ratio of *variance between groups* to *total variance*.  

<br>
$\rho = \frac{\sigma^2_{b}}{\sigma^2_{b} + \sigma^2_e} \\ \qquad \\\textrm{Where:} \\ \sigma^2_{b} = \textrm{variance between clusters} \\ \sigma^2_e = \textrm{variance within clusters (residual variance)} \\$

???
- let's look at a way we might quantify clustering
- for this, we have ICC

- basic premise = ratio of between cluster variance to the total variance  

--

Can also be interpreted as the correlation between two observations from the same group. 

???
- also sometimes interpreted as the expected correlation between two observations from the same group.
- take a random pair of children from the same school - record their grades
- take another pair, etc. what's the correlation?  

---
# ICC (intra-class correlation coefficient)

The larger the ICC, the lower the variability is within the clusters (relative to the variability between clusters). The greater the correlation between two observations from the same group.

# Clustered Data & Linear Models

.pull-left[
#### Why is it a problem?

Clustering is something **systematic** that our model should (arguably) take into account.  

- remember, $\varepsilon \sim N(0, \sigma) \textbf{ independently}$ 

]

--

.pull-right[
#### How is it a problem?  

Standard errors will often be smaller than they should be, meaning that:  

  - confidence intervals will often be too narrow 
  
  - $t$-statistics will often be too large  
  
  - $p$-values will often be misleadingly small

]

???
- all of this means, we have a PROBLEM, if we're wanting to carry on with simple linear regression

# Summary

- Clustering can take many forms, and exist at many levels  

- Clustering is something systematic that we would want our model to take into account

  - Ignoring it can lead to incorrect statistical inferences

- Clustering is typically assessed using intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) - the ratio of variance between clusters to the total variance $\rho = \frac{\sigma^2_b}{\sigma^2_b + \sigma^2_e}$

- Tidying your data and converting it to *long* format (one observational unit per row, and a variable identifying the cluster ID) is a good start.

in between these two approach is multilevel models, also termed "random effects models".  

and relative to the complete pooling (ignore the clustering) and no pooling (explicitly model cluster differences), this gets termed partial pooling.  

in multilevel models, the differences in clusters, in their intercepts and slopes, is modelled as a distribution around some fixed center. 

in this way the information from the clusters is partially pooled to contribute to an overal intercept and slope. 

the extent to which it contributes depends on how big the cluster is, and how far away it is from the rest of them. 

this makes sens right? i'm going to probably pay more attention to a school with 40 students than one with 2?

so in the plot, we have our overall intercept and line, and these are probably going to be the things we're interested in for our research, because we're not likely interested in the schools specifically..

but for each school, it has a deviation from the overall intercept to it's own intercept.

and a deviation from the overall slope to it's own slope.

# Summary

With clustered data, there are many possible approaches. Some of the main ones are:  

- Ignore it (**complete pooling**)  

    - and make inappropriate inferences.  

- Completely partition out any variance due to clustering into fixed effects for each cluster (__no pooling__).  

    - and limit our estimates to being cluster specific and low power.  
    
- Model cluster-level variance as randomly distributed around fixed parameters, __partially pooling__ information across clusters.  

    - best of both worlds?  
    

???
so that's just a taster of what's to come

- Traditional "ANOVA" is essentially a linear model with categorical predictor(s) where it looks for overall differences in group means (or differences in differences in group means etc).    

    - Still quite popular in psychology because we often design experiments with discrete conditions. 
    
    - Require post-hoc tests to examine _where_ any differences are.

# ANOVA revisited

In R, functions typically create anova tables from linear model objects:
```{r eval=F}
lin_mod <- lm(y ~ grp, df)
anova(lin_mod)
car::Anova(lin_mod)
```
or are wrappers which use the `lm()` function internally. So they're doing the same thing.
```{r eval=F}
summary(aov(y ~ grp, df))
```

```{r echo=FALSE,fig.height=3.5,fig.width=8,fig.align="center"}
ggplot(df,aes(x=grp, y=y,color=grp))+
  geom_jitter(width=.1)+
  stat_summary(fun.y = "mean",

.footnote[  
The terminology here can be a nightmare.  
$SS_{between}$ sometimes gets referred to as $SS_{model}$, $SS_{condition}$, $SS_{regression}$, or $SS_{treatment}$.  
Meanwhile $SS_{residual}$ also gets termed $SS_{error}$.  
To make it all worse, there are inconsistencies in the acronyms used, $SSR$ vs. $RSS$!

# (OPTIONAL) Advantages of MLM over ANOVA

- MLM can easily be extended to modelling different types of dependent variables. ANOVA cannot. 

- MLM can be extended to model more complex grouping structures (e.g. children in schools in districts, or independent clusters of both participants as well as experimental items)

- MLM provides more options for dealing with unbalanced designs and missing data.  

- Rpt Measures and Mixed ANOVA are special cases of the MLM! You can still get out your ANOVA-style tables from the MLM!
