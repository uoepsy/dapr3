**approx 5 marks**  

**show your working** (could get marks for this if answer is wrong)  

think, e.g.:  

- calculating icc from an intercept only model  
- calculating coef from fixef and ranef  
- calculating variance explained from eigenvalues
- calculating SS loadings

**approx 6-8 marks**  

often these ask to define a couple of things.  
1 to 2 sentences each thing.  

think, e.g.:  

- "ICC"
- "random effects and fixed effects"
- "no pooling/complete pooling/partial pooling"
- "factor loading"
- "reliability"

:::{.column width="50%" style="font-size:.8em"}
**approx 10 marks**  

you have done this in the report, and lots of times in labs.  

You know more than you think you do, e.g.:    

- start with an outcome variable.  
- ask yourself: "what in my question is asking about 'effects on Y'/'influences on Y'/'predicts Y'".  


*Tip: some methods we've covered lend themselves more to these sort of questions.*

:::

:::{.column width="50%" style="font-size:.8em"}
**approx 10-15 marks**  

you have done this in the report, and also seen it plenty of times in various forms in labs and lectures  

- the questions will list the things to comment on
- don't just parrot back numbers. provide *interpretation*  
    - you do NOT need to write out formally with stuff like "$b=.54, t(46)=2.1, p<.05$". This just wastes your time. Focus on interpreting the estimate, and mention if it's significant. 
- these usually provide information about the research aims, so place your answer in that context.

*Suggestion:* Take the main functions we have seen throughout DAPR3: `lmer()`, `principal()`, `fa()`, `cfa()`. Print an output from the lab/lectures and annotate it. what does each bit of the output represent?  

*Tip: some methods we've covered lend themselves more to these sort of questions.*   

:::
::::

## "Do I need to memorise code?"   

Short answer: Nope.  

__But...__ you should make sure you know how to use the main functions we've seen, and how to interpret their summary outputs:    

- `lmer()`
- `principal()`
- `fa()`
- `cfa()`

## breakdowns

::::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}

In almost all cases, an [X mark] question has been broken into sub-questions to help you focus on what to write.  

This might feel like more reading.  

We *have* managed to make sure that 1 question per page.

## breakdowns (the other sort)

- we all fail at some things^[I failed my first music exam because i hid in a cupboard. I failed a history of art exam at uni because i just drew a complete blank]
    - an exam is a test, and testing is not the same thing as measurement!  

- not the end of the world
    - in 2 years time, will it matter to you? (or to anyone?)
      (when did you stop caring about your school grades?)


## breakdowns (the other sort)

- stop. breathe. reset.  
    - in for 4, hold for 4, out for 4, hold for 4 ....
