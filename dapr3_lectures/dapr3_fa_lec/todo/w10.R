   # - e.g., length and angles of lines
  # split in two groups. one with fewer increments on scale

# then get them to rate set of properties of group of people

# go back to thing A, ask them to measure again

#  test re-test
# correlation thing A measurements, split by group


# inter rater
# rating of properties across raters
