    "text": "About DAPR3\nData Analysis for Psychology in R 3 (DAPR3) is a course undertaken by 3rd year students in Psychology. DAPR3 builds on the content of DAPR2 and covers more advanced methods that are invaluable for analysing many types of psychological study, preparing students for their dissertations. The course offers students a solid foundation in multilevel modeling, expanding the linear model to analyze “hierarchical data”. Such data often involves observations clustered within higher-level groups, such as trials within participants, timepoints within individuals, or children within schools. In the second half of the course, we delve into data reduction techniques. These methods allow us to effectively summarize multiple correlated variables, either through weighted composites or by positing underlying latent factors. Additionally, students will gain insights into crucial concepts, including measurement error, validity, reliability, and replicability. These concepts are especially essential for researchers in psychology, where surveys or questionnaires are used to conduct studies of underlying constructs that cannot be directly measured."

    "text": "Workplace Pride\n\nData: lmm_jsup.csv\nA questionnaire was sent to all UK civil service departments, and the lmm_jsup.csv dataset contains all responses that were received. Some of these departments work as hybrid or ‘virtual’ departments, with a mix of remote and office-based employees. Others are fully office-based.\nThe questionnaire included items asking about how much the respondent believe in the department and how it engages with the community, what it produces, how it operates and how treats its people. A composite measure of ‘workplace-pride’ was constructed for each employee. Employees in the civil service are categorised into 3 different roles: A, B and C. The roles tend to increase in responsibility, with role C being more managerial, and role A having less responsibility. We also have data on the length of time each employee has been in the department (sometimes new employees come straight in at role C, but many of them start in role A and work up over time).\nWe’re interested in whether the different roles are associated with differences in workplace-pride.\nDataset: https://uoepsy.github.io/data/lmm_jsup.csv.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\ndescription\n\n\n\n\ndepartment_name\nName of government department\n\n\ndept\nDepartment Acronym\n\n\nvirtual\nWhether the department functions as hybrid department with various employees working remotely (1), or as a fully in-person office (0)\n\n\nrole\nEmployee role (A, B or C)\n\n\nseniority\nEmployees seniority point.

Think back to previous courses – it’s time for some means, standard deviations, mins and maxes. For categorical variables we can do counts or proportions.\nWe’ve seen various functions such as summary(), and also describe() from the psych package.\nFor continuous variables, histograms are a good first port of call: try hist(). For categorical variables, you could try plotting the outcome of table().\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 1.

Based on this plot and your training from DAPR2, try to answer these questions:\n\nIf you fit a model to this data, how would the predictor be coded?\nWhat coefficients would the model estimate?\nWould the sign of the coefficients be positive or negative?\n\nOnce you’ve made a good effort to predict the answers to these questions, fit a model and see if your predictions are borne out. (If your predictions are different from the outcomes, reflect on why the outcomes are the way they are.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\ndoes y [continuous variable] differ by x [three groups]?\nlm(y ~ x)?\nBy default, R uses treatment coding (aka dummy coding), and the reference level is the one that comes first in the alphabet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 2. \n\nmod1 &lt;- lm(wp ~ role, data = jsup)\n\nRather than doing summary(model) - I’m just going to use the broom package to pull out some of the stats in nice tidy dataframes.\nThe glance() function will give us things like the \\(R^2\\) values and \\(F\\)-statistic (basically all the stuff that is at the bottom of the summary()):\n\nlibrary(broom)\nglance(mod1)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 12\n  r.squared adj.r.squared sigma statistic  p.value    df logLik   AIC   BIC\n      &lt;dbl&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     0.216         0.211  4.68      40.3 3.44e-16     2  -872. 1753. 1768.\n# ℹ 3 more variables: deviance &lt;dbl&gt;, df.residual &lt;int&gt;, nobs &lt;int&gt;\n\n\nThe tidy() function will give us the coefficients, standard errors, t-statistics and p-values.

Specifically, compared to people in role A, people who are in roles B and C on average report less pride in the workplace.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3\n\n\nOne possibility: Something about the roles themselves makes people report differences in workplace pride.\nAnother possibility: People who are newer to the company feel more pride (they’re less jaded), and people in Role A tend to be newer. So something else is at play, but the model above makes it look like it’s about role.\nIn other words, if we were to compare people in each role but hold constant their employment_length, might we see something different?\nMake a plot that shows all these relevant variables. Based on that plot, have a guess at the following questions:\n\nWhat coefficients will be estimated by a model fit to this data?\nWould the sign of the coefficients be positive or negative?\n\nOnce you’ve made a good effort to predict the answers to these questions, fit a model and see. (If your predictions are different from the outcomes, reflect on why the outcomes are the way they are.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nSo we want to adjust for how long people have been part of the company..\nRemember - if we want to estimate the effect of x on y while adjusting for z, we can do lm(y ~ z + x).\nFor the plot - put something on the x, something on the y, and colour it by the other variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 3. \n\nmod2 &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length + role, data = jsup)\n\ntidy(mod2)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term              estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)         36.1      0.709     50.9   6.90e-147\n2 employment_length   -0.834    0.0637   -13.1   4.32e- 31\n3 roleB                0.510    0.563      0.906 3.65e-  1\n4 roleC               -0.704    0.663     -1.06  2.89e-  1\n\n\nNote that, after adjusting for employment length, there are no significant differences in wp between roles B or C compared to A.\nIf we plot the data to show all these variables together, we can kind of see why! Given the pattern of wp against employment_length, the wp for different roles are pretty much where we would expect them to be if role doesn’t make any difference (i.e., if role doesn’t shift your wp up or down).\n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x=employment_length,y=wp,col=role))+\n  geom_point(size=3,alpha=.3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 4\n\n\nDo roles differ in their workplace-pride, when adjusting for time in the company?\nPhrased differently: Does role contribute usefully to our model of workplace pride, or is accounting for employment length enough?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThis may feel like a repeat of the previous question, but note that this is not a question about specific group differences. It is about whether, overall, the role groups differ. So it’s wanting to test the joint effect of the two additional parameters we’ve just added to our model. (hint hint model comparison!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 4. \n\nmod2a &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length, data = jsup)\nmod2 &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length + role, data = jsup)\n\nanova(mod2a, mod2)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: wp ~ employment_length\nModel 2: wp ~ employment_length + role\n  Res.Df  RSS Df Sum of Sq    F Pr(&gt;F)\n1    293 4091                         \n2    291 4029  2      61.9 2.23   0.11\n\n\nThis is no surprise given the previous question, we just now have a single test to report if we wanted to - after accounting for employment length, role does not explain a significant amount of variance in workplace pride.\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 5\n\n\nLet’s take a step back and remember what data we actually have. We’ve got 295 people in our dataset, from 16 departments.\nDepartments may well differ in the general amount of workplace-pride people report. People love to say that they work in the “National Crime Agency”, but other departments might not elicit such pride (*cough* HM Revenue & Customs *cough*). We need to be careful not to mistake department differences as something else (like differences due to the job role).\nMake a couple of plots to look at:\n\nhow many of each role we have from each department\nhow departments differ in their employees’ pride in their workplace\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 5. \n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x = role)) + \n  geom_bar()+\n  facet_wrap(~dept)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, it looks like most of the departments have similar numbers of each role, apart from the UKSA (“UK Statistics Authority”), where we’ve got loads more of role A, and very few role C..\nNote also that in the plot below, the UKSA is, on average, full of employees who take a lot of pride in their work. Is this due to the high proportion of people in role A? or is the effect of role we’re seeing more due to differences in departments?\n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x = dept, y = wp)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = label_wrap_gen(35)) + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven if we had perfectly equal numbers of roles in each department, we’re also adjusting for other things such as employment_length, and the extent to which this differs by department can have trickle-on effects on our coefficient of interest (the role coefficients).\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 6\n\n\nAdjusting for both length of employment and department, are there differences in ‘workplace-pride’ between the different roles? Fit a model to find out.\nCan you make a plot of all four of the variables involved in our model?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nMaking the plot might take some thinking. We’ve now added dept into the mix, so a nice way might be to use facet_wrap() to make the same plot as the one we did previously, but for each department.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 6. \n\nmod3 &lt;- lm(wp ~ employment_length + dept + role, data = jsup)\ntidy(mod3)\n\n# A tibble: 19 × 5\n   term              estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 (Intercept)        36.4       0.631    57.6    7.17e-156\n 2 employment_length  -0.882     0.0344  -25.7    4.71e- 75\n 3 deptCMA            -3.80      0.649    -5.85   1.39e-  8\n 4 deptCPS            -0.217     0.730    -0.298  7.66e-  1\n 5 deptFSA             4.74      0.625     7.60   4.71e- 13\n 6 deptGLD             0.0582    0.682     0.0853 9.32e-  1\n 7 deptHMRC           -3.79      0.692    -5.47   1.02e-  7\n 8 deptNCA            -3.85      0.655    -5.88   1.18e-  8\n 9 deptNS&I           -0.574     0.654    -0.878  3.81e-  1\n10 deptOFGEM          -0.648     0.705    -0.919  3.59e-  1\n11 deptOFQUAL         -4.94      1.01     -4.89   1.71e-  6\n12 deptOFSTED         -5.88      0.683    -8.61   5.52e- 16\n13 deptOFWAT          -1.21      0.692    -1.75   8.17e-  2\n14 deptORR            -2.85      0.681    -4.18   3.98e-  5\n15 deptSFO            -1.36      0.672    -2.02   4.47e-  2\n16 deptUKSA            4.28      0.576     7.43   1.32e- 12\n17 deptUKSC           -2.31      0.732    -3.16   1.77e-  3\n18 roleB               1.42      0.303     4.68   4.47e-  6\n19 roleC               1.31      0.366     3.59   3.92e-  4\n\n\nIn a way, adding predictors to our model is kind of like splitting up our plots by that predictor to see the patterns. This becomes more and more difficult (/impossible) as we get more variables, but right now we can split the data into all the constituent parts.\n\nggplot(jsup, aes(x = employment_length, y = wp, col = role)) +\n  geom_point(size=3,alpha=.4)+\n  facet_wrap(~dept)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe association between wp and employment_length is clear in all these little sub-plots - there’s a downward trend. The department differences can be seen too: UKSA is generally a bit higher, HMRC and UKSC a bit lower, and so on. By default, the model captures these coefficients as ‘differences from the reference group’, so all these coefficients are in relation to the “ACE” department.\nSeeing the role differences is a bit harder in this plot, but think about what you would expect to see if there were no differences in roles (i.e. imagine if they were all in role A). Take for instance the FSA department, where this is easiest to see - for the people who are in role C, for people of their employment length we would expect their wp to be lower if they were in role A. Likewise for those in role B. Across all these departments, the people in role B and C (green and blue dots respectively) are a bit higher than we would expect. This is what the model coefficients tell us!\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7\n\n\nNow we’re starting to acknowledge the grouped structure of our data - these people in our dataset are related to one another in that some belong to dept 1, some dept 2, and so on..\nLet’s try to describe our sample in a bit more detail.\n\nhow many participants do we have, and from how many departments?\nhow many participants are there, on average, from each department? what is the minimum and maximum?\nwhat is the average employment length for our participants?\nhow many departments are ‘virtual departments’ vs office-based?\n\nwhat is the overall average reported workplace-pride?\nhow much variation in workplace-pride is due to differences between departments?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHints\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first lot of these questions can be answered using things like count(), summary(), table(), mean(), min() etc. See 1: Clustered Data #determining-sample-sizes\nFor the last one, we can use the ICC! See 1: Clustered Data #icc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 7.

What happens?\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\nSolution 8. Let’s add the virtual predictor to our model.

If we think about it, if we separate out “differences due to departments” then there is nothing left to compare between departments that are virtual vs office based. Adding the between-department predictor of virtual doesn’t explain anything more - the residual sums of squares doesn’t decrease at all:\n\nanova(\n  lm(wp ~ employment_length + dept + role, data = jsup),\n  lm(wp ~ employment_length + dept + role + virtual, data = jsup)\n)\n\nAnalysis of Variance Table\n\nModel 1: wp ~ employment_length + dept + role\nModel 2: wp ~ employment_length + dept + role + virtual\n  Res.Df  RSS Df Sum of Sq F Pr(&gt;F)\n1    276 1084                      \n2    276 1084  0         0         \n\n\nAnother way of thinking about this: knowing the average workplace-pride for the department that someone is in tells me what to expect about that person’s workplace pride. But once I know their department’s average workplace-pride, knowing whether it is ‘virtual’ or ‘office-based’ doesn’t tell me anything new, for the very fact that the virtual/office-based distinction comes from comparing different departments.\nBut we’re not really interested in these departments specifically! What would be nice would be if we can look at the relevant effects of interest (things like role and virtual), but then just think of the department differences as just some sort of random variation. So we want to think of departments in a similar way to how we think of our individual employees - they vary randomly around what we expect - only they’re at a different level of observation."
